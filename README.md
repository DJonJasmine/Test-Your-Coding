## Name
Coding Quiz

## Description
This quiz will test your knowledge of Javascript. With 60 seconds on the timer, think fast to click the right answer! Upon finishing the quiz you can save your high score. Can you beat your record?

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
If you come across a bug or just have any feedback, support can be contacted at DJonHarrison94@gmail.com!


## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.
